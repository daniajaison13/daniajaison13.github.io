I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and 3 years of experience as a Software Engineer, where I focused on building scalable backend services using Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and AWS, along with frontend development in ReactJS and JavaScript. I'm particularly drawn to roles that involve solving infrastructure and reliability challenges at scale.
